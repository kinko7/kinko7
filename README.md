In 2021 I made a decision to changed my professional life. I was a theater teacher for more than 10 years and started studying programming at HENRY where i spent more than 800hrs learning Javascript, React, Redux, NodeJS and others stacks,
burning neurons with a lot of enthusiasm to learn and achieve that great change in life. Today i am a Full-Stack Developer seeking for new challenge to learn, share and grow personally and professionally.-

A few things about me:

I am a person with great common sense and joy because that is how I choose the way to live-.
In my spare time I enjoy doing things in my house to improve it, decorating, gardering ... everything I do with my hands, I enjoy it a lot ... I also love cooking for my family and friends.-
I worked as a Teacher, in Arts , I´m very pacient and always trying to help others to make their lives a little more pleasant and fun.-
I will be glad to hear from you..
Contac me at this e-mail : carlosmarleta@gmail.com
Have a good day and enjoy life!
